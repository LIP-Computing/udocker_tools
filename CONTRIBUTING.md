# Contributing

## Introduction

Thanks for considering contributing to udocker_setup.
Contributions to udocker_setup are welcome.
You can contribute by improving the documentation, submit bug reports,
provide feature requests, or writing code for udocker its installation
and testing.

## Ground Rules

We aim at having portability, udocker_setup is meant to be executed both
on older distributions (such as CentOS 6) and newer, so beware of
which python features you use and whether they are supported in
older distributions.

udocker_setup is an installer for udocker and thus, supports the same
python versions as udocker, i.e. python 2.7 and python >=3.6
