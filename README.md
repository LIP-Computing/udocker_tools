udocker_setup is an installer for udocker with a rich CLI, allowing
flexibility in installed modules and execution engines.

udocker is a basic user tool to execute simple docker containers in user
space without requiring root privileges. Enables download and execution
of docker containers by non-privileged users in Linux systems where
docker is not available. It can be used to pull and execute docker
containers in Linux batch systems and interactive clusters that are
managed by other entities such as grid infrastructures or externally
managed batch or interactive systems.
